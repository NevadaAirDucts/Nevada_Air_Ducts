                    <th><p style="font-size: 20px; background: rgb(206, 123, 68);">HVAC air filters vary in size and function depending on the brand of the filter  and your heating and cooling system. Generally,<br> your air filter should be replaced at least once every 90-days.  Most homes and offices typically have their HVAC running <br>all day to prevent the extreme temperatures of Las Vegas from affecting them. Because of this, the air filter can get very dirty <br>quickly.

                        Las Vegas is known for its desert landscaping, so dust, dirt, and other allergens are no stranger to the city. These allergens can make <br>their way into your air duct system, which can cause your allergies to flare up and cause poor air quality. However, routine <br>air filter replacement is necessary to minimize exposure.</p></th>

    <p>Most homeowners don’t think about their air ducts until they start having problems with them. But keeping your ducts clean is an important part of maintaining a healthy home.

        <p>Your air ducts need to be cleaned at least once a year. Las Vegas is a dry desert that’s home to dust, dirt, and debris. Since rainfall is very scarce, this makes it the perfect breeding ground for pollen and other allergens. Over time, these allergens can make their way into your air ducts and cause issues with your sinuses and allergies.

            However, getting an annual air duct cleaning in North Las Vegas can minimize your exposure to indoor allergens and boost energy efficiency. A clear air duct means that your AC system isn’t working as hard to deliver the desired room temperature. Not only does this cut energy costs, but it extends the lifespan of your HVAC system.</p>

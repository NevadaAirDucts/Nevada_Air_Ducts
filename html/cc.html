				<br><br>
				<p>Chimney cleaning in Las Vegas increases fire safety in your home. AirDuct Cleaning recommends getting chimney cleaning at least once a year if you frequently use it during winter. Soot, dirt, and dust can build up within your chimney. This buildup is extremely flammable and obstructs the smoke pathway. Get in touch with us today to schedule your service with our chimney cleaners.

            <p>Here are the benefits of residential chimney cleaning:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                   <li>Decreases fire hazards</li>
                    <li>Improves home safety</li>
                    <li>Increases chimney functionality</li>
                    <li>Extends chimney lifespan</li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>
                The biggest benefit of cleaning your chimney is that it decreases any fire hazards from a blocked chimney. Woodfires produce soot and other contaminants that get filtered out from your home through the chimney. Over time, these particles can clog up your chimney and block the direction of the smoke. This is extremely dangerous since soot is extremely flammable, and the direction of the smoke can stay within your home, which increases carbon monoxide levels.
                
                AirDuct Cleaning recommends a chimney cleaning at least once a year. This keeps your home safe, clean, and protected from any issues that may come from your chimney. Each year, hundreds of homes are impacted by fires, so donâ€™t let your home be part of that statistic.</p>
